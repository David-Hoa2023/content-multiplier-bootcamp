# Cloudflare Pages Configuration
# Note: For GitHub-based deployments, configure these settings in Cloudflare Pages dashboard

# Recommended Cloudflare Pages Settings:
# Framework preset: Next.js (Static HTML Export)
# Build command: npm run build:cloudflare
# Build output directory: frontend/out
# Root directory: (leave as repository root)
# Node.js version: 18.17.0
